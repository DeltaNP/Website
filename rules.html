<h6>- Discord Rules</h6>
<p>Please read carefully! Be wary that staff members may act in their own accord, and that these rules are not an exhaustive list of what is and isn't permitted. Use good judgment! Ask questions in DMs if you're unsure.</p>

<h6>- Read the Discord Community Guidelines!</h6>
<p>You can check those out here: https://dis.gd/guidelines & https://dis.gd/tos</p>

<h6>- Excessive swearing and inappropriate language is not allowed.</h6>
<p>While we permit swearing, if a staff member finds it excessive, you will be punished. Similarly, slurs of any kind are not allowed.</p>

<h6>- Please don't spam!</h6>
<p>Sending messages in rapid succession, sending large chat flooding messages, and general incoherent nonsense being pushed out into the chat isn't allowed. Our bot is pretty good at catching spam, but if you have any concerns about your mute/ban please contact staff!</p>

<h6>- Please keep your username/avatar appropriate.</h6>
<p>No vulgar language in your username, no depictions of nudity or gore should be in your avatar.</p>

<h6>- You aren't allowed to minimod in the server:</h6>
<p> This means acting as a moderator by threatening that people will be punished <br> If you have a problem please ping an active staff member </p>

<h6>-  Don't advertise!</h6>
<p>No advertising Discord Servers, DMâ€™ing unsolicited invites, or other programs, websites or services.</p>

<h6>-  Be respectful.</h6>
<p>We can't list every rule here, or make a rule for every situation, but we can request of you to be respectful. Don't go out of your way to make someone feel uncomfortable. Don't attack someone, don't be inappropriate. Just have a good time creating a proper environment for one another. Be your best self.</p>
